= Support

- {product-title-short} is tested with and fully supported by Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, formerly {ocp}. 

- {product-title-short} supports the function of the multicluster observability operator on user-provided third-party object storage that is S3 API compatible. The observability service uses Thanos supported, stable object stores.

- {product-title-short} use commercial, reasonable efforts to assist in the identification of the root cause. If a support ticket is raised and the root cause has been determined to be a result of the customer-provided S3 compatible object storage, then the issue must be resolved using the customer support channels.

- {product-title-short} does not commit to fix support tickets raised by customers, where the root cause identified is the S3 compatible object storage provider.
